Proposal : 

1) ~~Automatic Revision for User Guide~~
   * ~~issue : (0000310: No automatic revision on modification of a user guide)~~
   * The current workflow requires, a user to manually add revisions when he is editing, proposed is an automatic versioning system whenever any content is edited.
2) ~~Diff between revisions of manual pages~~
   * ~~issue : (0000311:Showing diff of revisions)~~
   * The current revision system, allows any user to have revisions of a document, but there is no system by which changes made between two particular revisions could be seen. Proposed is the implementation of such a feature in sigmah.org.
3) Setting up a mailing list server, and its integration with the sigmah-website
   * issue : (0000373:Add discussion list management for Steering Cooperative mailing list)
   * This would not only allow mailing lists and private archives for the Steering Cooperative Committee, but also for any group/role present on the website (viz. Developers, Beta testers, Editors, and individual organic groups created by the users)
4) Improvements to the usability of the current forum :
   * issue : (0000418:Improve image insertion usability)
   * issue : (0000328:Add a management of “blockquote” HTML tag)
   * issue : (0000455: Better Integration of the Issues Tracker with the Sigmah-website project)
5) Better Image integration with the WYSIWYG Editor.
   * Add support for blockquotes, and other such HTML styling features which are currently not supported
   * Work on the theming of the current form, to give it a more aesthetic and engaging feel.
   * Ability to insert title and link to issues just by typing a pattern in the wysiwyg editor (viz. say typing #_393_ would map to issue number 393 in the sigmah issue tracker and be replaced by 393:Sample Issue Title, and also automatically hyperlinked to the particular issue.
6) Improvements to the current Subscriptions system :
   * issue : (0000452:Notification/Subscriptions too complex for end user)
   * Implementation of the ability to follow Forum posts even without commenting in them
7) User Dashboard :
   * Set up dashboards for user, to let them keep track of things like, Topics they have posted in, Topics they are following, and other widgets like “Most popular Forum topics”, “latest posts by a particular user” , etc.
8) User profile pictures :
   * issue : (0000322::Add a table of all community member)
   * Setting up the User Profile pictures, and then using them to build Community Galleries.
9) Deployment of all the solutions to the issues  already posted on the sigmah-issue tracker.
10) Work on the Technical Documentation of the sigmah-website project, to help other contributors understand the project better and faster.:
   * ~~issue : (0000445:Getting the sigmah website code up and working on your machine)~~

####Self NOTES


1) ####Automatic Revision for User Guide :
   * Revision configured only for Book Page Content Type
   * The default "create revision" checkbox on the Node edit page has been removed, because it is redundant if we want to force revisions with every edit.
   * The "commit" message or revision log has not been enforced though, it depends on the user if he/she wishes to leave a commit message for the admins.
   * Expected Behaviour tested on local copy of the software !! Working Fine !!

2) ####Diff between revisions of manual pages
   * Now anyone with "view revision" permissions will see a new column for diff on the revisions page
   * The new column will be named "show diff" and will be sub divided into two more columns !! There are Radio buttons for every revision available in both the sub columns.
   * Selecting two different revisions using the two columns, and then clicking on "show diff" will show the git style diff between both the revisions with "-" signifying deletion of line and "+" signifying addition of line.
   * The diff engine is based on a GPLed phpWiki diff engine
   * Expected Behaviour tested on local copy of the software !! Working Fine !!

3) Ability to insert title and link to issues just by typing a pattern in the wysiwyg editor (viz. say typing #_393_ would map to issue number 393 in the sigmah issue tracker and be replaced by 393:Sample Issue Title, and also automatically hyperlinked to the particular issue.
   * the text entered through the "FUll HTML input format" and "Filtered HTML input format" are searched for regular expressions of the form  #{numbers} and they are mapped to the appropriate issue number on the sigmah issue tracker
   * I have done simple URL mapping as of now, meaning, it is NOT checked if the issue exists or not
   * Planning to include a MySQL query which looks for the particular issue in the Mantis Database and returns error if the issue doesnot exist, gives back other information like title of the issue to use in the hyperlink in the text.
   * Expected Behaviour tested on local copy of the software !! Working Fine !!
   * Planning a few modifications after getting in touch with Olivier
   * @Olivier : When can you give me a sql dump of the current Mantis Issue tracker database (Data obscured, ofcourse) , would help testing this feature.
'  * @Olivier : to refer to issues, what convention exactly to use ? the most obvious would be of the form #<numbers> , but hash can naturally occur next to a number, again creating confusion, I have used the Ruby on Rails convention for inline variables, i.e. #{numbers} , but I am not sure, how comfertable would be people using it. Let me know if you have any paricular pattern in mind.
