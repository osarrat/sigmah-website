Presentation
------------

Sigmah website GitHub project is a project following the evolution of the code
of the Sigmah Drupal website.

Sigmah is Humanitarian Project Management Open Source Software.

You can see the production version of this website at: http://www.sigmah.org/


How to start ?
--------------
1. Install locally a PHP/MySQL server 
   i) If you are on Windows , you can use : [WAMP server](http://www.wampserver.com/en/)
   ii) If you are on MAC OSX, you can use : [XAMPP-MaxOSx Server](http://www.apachefriends.org/en/xampp-macosx.html)
   iii) If you are on Linux, you will have to setup a LAMP server, based on your distro:
   	a) Ubuntu and other Debian distributions:

	   	  ```
	   	    sudo apt-get install tasksel

		    sudo tasksel install lamp-server
		  ```
			(Note : tasksel does work on a few other Debian distributions, but it is mostly a ubuntu specific package installer)
			
		 If tasksel is not available for you distribution, you can try the following set of commands which use apt-get
		   ```
			apt-get install update
			apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5
			apt-get install mysql-server mysql-client php5-mysql
		   ```
         b) Other linux distributions which support yum :
	    	  ```
			yum update
			yum install httpd
			yum install php php-pear php-mysql
			yum install mysql-server mysql
		  ```
	
	(If still the apache server doesnot start or process php files, you can try restarting the services once)
	    	  ```
			sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

			sudo /etc/init.d/mysqld restart
		  ``` 

		      or

		   ```
			sudo service httpd restart

			sudo service mysqld restart
		   ```
			Whichever is applicable for your distribution
		 
2. Create a database "sigmah_website" accessible from the user 'root' in your
  MySQL database and import the database from the sql file provided.
		
		You can either achieve this through the phpMyadmin provided by default in you WAMP or XAMPP stacks, or if you are on Linux and you dont have phpMyadmin , you can use the following command :
		  ```
			mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE sigmah_website;"
		  ```
		  Then it will ask for password, the default password is blank, so a simple enter should do the job if it a newly set up LAMP stack, or you will have to enter thr root password setup on your mysql server.

		  Now you have created the database, you will have to import the database dump present. Find the file named sigmah_website.sql file. And if you are on Windows or MAC OSx, use the phpMyadmin interface to import the database contents into your newly created database, or if you are on linux, then use the following command
		  
		  ```
		  mysql -u root -p -d sigmah_website < <path_to_sql_file>
		  ```

			This will again ask for password, either give the default blank password or give your custom password.
		  	  
3. Create an Apache alias named "sigmah-website" to your local copy of the 
  content of this Git repo.

4. Configure you apache server to let the sigmah-website use clean urls.

   Cleans URLS are enabled by default, so for you to be able to use it, your apache server has to allow the sigmah-website project override the default settings bu custom .htaccess files, so locate the operative httpd.conf file 
or apache2.conf file whichever is applicable, and add the following lines

   		```
		<Directory /var/www/sigmah-website>
			   AllowOverride All
		</Directory>
		```
		(Assuming /var/www/sigmah-website is the path to your project directory )

5. Open in your web browser the URL pointing to this alias 
  (like http://127.0.0.1:8000/sigmah-website/, but it depends on your local
  Apache server config).
6. Log on to the website with the login/password "user3"/"sigmah" to log on with
  a user account which has all privileges.
=> You're in !

7. Now for the integration of the sigmah website with the issue tracker, the database config details are to be updated at :

```
<your base url>/admin/settings/customfilter/1/1/edit
```

in the text box with heading replacement text, you will find an associtive array :
// Database config details
$db = array(
'server' => '127.0.01',
'username' => 'root',
'password' => '',
'database' => 'mantis'
);

there you can replace the username,password,database name,server address, etc of the Mantis issue tracker, and then click save, and you are ready to go :)



For information: all user accounts have "sigmah" as password.
